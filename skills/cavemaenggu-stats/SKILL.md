This skill is delivered by `hooks/cavemaenggu-stats.js` (read by `hooks/cavemaenggu-mode-tracker.js` on `/cavemaenggu-stats`). The model does not need to do anything when this skill fires — the hook returns `decision: "block"` with the formatted stats as the reason. The user sees the numbers immediately.
